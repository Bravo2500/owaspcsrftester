Description:

Just when developers are starting to run in circles over Cross Site Scripting, the 'sleeping giant' awakes for yet another web-catastrophe. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack whereby the victim is tricked into loading information from or submitting information to a web application for which they are currently authenticated. The problem is that the web application has no means of verifying the integrity of the request. The OWASP CSRFTester Project attempts to give developers the ability to test their applications for CSRF flaws.
